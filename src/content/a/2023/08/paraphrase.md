*“Logic studies arguments, which consist of a set of premises together with a conclusion. An example is the argument from the premises "it's Sunday" and "if it's Sunday then I don't have to work" to the conclusion "I don't have to work". \[1\] Premises and conclusions express propositions or claims that can be true or false. An important feature of propositions is their internal structure. For example, complex propositions are made up of simpler propositions linked by logical vocabulary like and or “if...then.” Simple propositions also have parts, like "Sunday" or "work" in the example. The truth of a proposition usually depends on the meanings of all of its parts. However, this is not the case for logically true propositions. They are true only because of their logical structure independent of the specific meanings of the individual parts.”*

Logic is the study of arguments. Arguments consist of premises and a conclusion, for example: “It's snowing” and “if it's snowing school is canceled” as the premise and the conclusion “I don’t have to go to school.” A complex proposition is the essence of the argument and is made up of simpler propositions linked by logical vocabulary such as “if … then” or “and.” Usually a preposition is true because of the meanings of the parts that make up the simple prepositions except in logical prepositions where, as Wikipedia says, “They \[speaking of a logical preposition\] are true only because of their logical structure independent of the specific meanings of the individual parts.”
