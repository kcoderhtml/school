Thesis Statement: We need leaders in our government that understand technology and can advocate for more strict privacy regulations.  
Examples of companies infringing on privacy: Clearview AI, an app that, with just a photo of a face, you can find out everything about that person. Facebook's context advertising, eye add tracking and unauthorized conversation recording. The advertising business.  
Revision: Limiting online usage of children is something best left to parents and not the government.
