*"True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost." \- Arthur Ashe*  

The Odyssey is an ancient epic about the trials of Odysseus, a man who had left house and home to serve in the Trojan war. He travels home from Troy and blinds the cyclops Polyphemus, son of Poseidon. This causes the cyclops to curse him and from then on Odysseus is worked against by Poseidon. When Odysseus finally returns home after many trials, he finds his house full of suitors devouring his food and trying to marry his wife. He plots a trap for the men and slaughters them, finally regaining his home and family. Odysseus was considered by the Greeks to be a hero for his prowess in battle, but according to Arthur Ashe’s description of what true heroism is, he fails at being a hero.  

The first reason to not count Odysseus as a hero is that he often prioritized his own goals and pride over his crew. For example, when Polyphemus was blinded by Odysseus and his men, Odysseus didn't quietly slip away, but instead boasted to the cyclops his name, which brought a curse upon his entire crew. When they pass the island of the sirens, he needlessly listens to their song, endangering himself and his crew. Also, when on the island of Circe, he chooses to engage in a romantic relationship with the woman who had just tried to kill him and his crew. This proves Odysseus to be unfaithful as well as reckless.  

Odysseus' lack of respect for life is another concerning character trait that does not agree with serving others at all costs. When at the island of the Cicones, Odysseus, led by greed and a desire to plunder, attacks the city without properly accessing the situation. After raiding the city, leading to a loss of life on the Cicones’ side, they lingered and celebrated, leading to many of Odysseus’ men being killed. Odysseus also fails to cut short several situations where he had the ability to leave, such as Calypso and Circe’s islands. He also fails to honor his marriage vows in both situations, which was a breach of his wife’s trust and the laws of the day.  

Finally, Odysseus, at his return, lies in wait for the suitors, prolonging the grief he has caused for his servants, wife, and father. After finally revealing himself, he kills 108 men in cold blood, in what could have been needless slaughter. Odysseus doesn’t give the suitors any time to respond or apologize and even when some do beg his mercy, he heartlessly kills them.  

In conclusion, Odysseus showed many instances of failing to uphold moral and ethical standards. In his killing of the suitors, he shows a lack of respect for life, quite acceptable for the time, but his failure to protect his men and his violation of his marriage vows were unacceptable then and now. According to Odysseus’ moral and ethical violations, and Arthur Ashe’s description of a hero, Odysseus should not be considered a hero.
