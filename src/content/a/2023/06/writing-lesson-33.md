2. Hippolita, Manfred’s wife, is a kind woman who is concerned that her only son is too young to marry, but she obeys the wishes of her husband regarding the marriage.  
3. On the day of his wedding, young Conrad walks across the courtyard and is killed by a giant helmet that fell from the sky.  
4. Isabella is repulsed by Fred's proposal to marry her and tries to escape to a church through a tunnel.  
5. Isabella meets a gallant young gentleman in the tunnel who helps her to escape, but Manfred captures the gentleman.

## Exercise B:

1. Because he proved himself a great warrior, Odysseus leaves Troy for home.  
2. Because Odysseus killed the cyclops, Polyphemus, the god Neptune is angry with him.  
3. Because Polyphemus returned to his cave, Odysseus and his band of men became trapped in the Cyclops’ cave.  
4. While Polyphemus promptly ate two of the men, the others watched in horror and disbelief.  
5. Because Odysseus tricked the cyclops by getting him drunk, he, with the help of his other men, were able to blind Polyphemus with a hot stake.
