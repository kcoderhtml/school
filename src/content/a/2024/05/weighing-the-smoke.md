Did you know that voters in 24 states have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and that voters in 38 states have authorized it for medical use? This once prohibited plant has been making news headlines recently and has become an issue on the ballot of many states, where voters have to weigh the merits of allowing marijuana or keeping it banned. This essay attempts to weigh the potential consequences of both courses of action.  

On one hand, people will use marijuana regardless of whether it's legal or not. Making it a legal and regulated substance would incentivize people to purchase it from licensed dispensaries instead of the black market. This shift would reduce crime associated with illegal drug sales. Unlike black market transactions, legal dispensaries operate under regulations, minimizing the risk of violence and gang activity. Additionally, these establishments are required to test their products for potency and contaminants, ensuring a safer product for consumers. This is especially important for those with compromised immune systems who may be using marijuana for pain relief, as they are more vulnerable to infections from mold or other contaminants that could be present in unregulated marijuana. (Verweij, P E et al.)

However, legalizing marijuana also raises concerns about potential health risks, particularly for young people. Legalizing marijuana will almost certainly increase its normality and lead young adults and adolescents to view it as a normal part of society. In addition, dispensaries make it more accessible than on the black market. Studies show that marijuana use can have more pronounced negative effects on young people compared to adults, including increased dependency rates (Kandel, D et al.). Furthermore, smoking marijuana results in inhaling 3 times as much tar and having 5 times higher blood carboxyhemoglobin (a measure of carbon monoxide in the blood) compared to cigarettes (Wu, T C et al.). These findings raise concerns about potential respiratory harm. Adding to these concerns, the marijuana plant contains over 60 different cannabinoids (the active agents), of which only 21 are currently under active study by the FDA (Svrakic, Dragan M et al.). With the remaining cannabinoids' effects largely unknown, there's a potential risk of unforeseen health consequences, especially for young people whose brains are still developing.  

One further effect of legalizing marijuana would be the generation of significant tax revenue for states. Following legalization and implementation of a licensing system, Washington State saw marijuana tax revenue exceeding $2 million per day. The Tax Foundation predicts that "a mature marijuana industry could generate up to $28 billion in tax revenues for federal, state, and local governments, including $7 billion in federal revenue" (Ekins and Bishop-Henchman). If a significant portion, perhaps 10%, of this tax revenue were directed towards marijuana research, similar to how taxes on tobacco and alcohol contribute to research on those substances, the benefits could be substantial. This research could unlock the potential medical applications of marijuana for a wider range of conditions, provide a clearer picture of its long-term health effects, and inform the development of evidence-based regulations for safe and responsible use.   

In summary, the legalization of Marijuana is a complex and understudied issue that is rapidly being rolled out on to the ballots of voters across the United States. While concerns exist regarding potential health risks, particularly for young people, legalization could also lead to increased tax revenue, reduced crime associated with the black market, and improved access to medical marijuana for those who need it. Ultimately, the decision to legalize or not to legalize is a complex matter that requires a meticulous assessment of the potential ramifications of legalizing mby the voter, and offers both advantages and disadvantages. Ongoing research is a crucial piece of knowledge for the voter and lawmaker that we largely don’t have and that we, urgently, moving forward, need to see more of to allow us to make more informed decisions.
