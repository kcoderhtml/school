| **Worldview** | **Belief about God** | **Nature of Reality** | **View of Humanity** | **Key Figures** |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Theism**        | God is personally involved with humankind.         | Universe is divinely created and purposive, nature is controlled by God, history is linear. | Humans are stewards of creation, created in God's image. | Homer, Virgil, C.S. Lewis, Tolkien  |
| **Deism**         | God was present but is no longer active.           | The world functions like a clock, created by God but now runs on its own.              | Humanity follows Judeo-Christian morality.         | Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson       |
| **Romanticism**   | God is identified with nature.                     | Nature is idealized, truth and good are relative and changing.                         | Humans are complex animals, driven by intuition.   | James Fenimore Cooper, Goethe        |
| **Naturalism**    | God is either uninterested or mean (if He exists). | Reality is governed by impersonal natural laws, life is transient, truth is culture-conditioned. | Humanity's ultimate destination is death.          | Joseph Conrad, Stephen Crane         |
| **Realism**       | No God, no purpose or meaning in the universe.     | Reality is harsh, only measurable experiences are real, bad things happen to good people. | Personality has no ultimate status, human rights are conditional. | Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald |
| **Absurdism**     | No god, no need for one.                           | Everything is disorganized, anarchy rules, there is no cosmic explanation.             | Indifference towards existence and deities.        | John Barth, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.       |
| **Existentialism**| God is irrelevant, truth is relative.              | Reality is subjective and open to interpretation, leading to pessimism.                | Humans must create their own meaning.              | Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, Jean-Paul Sartre |
