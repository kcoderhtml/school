*Kieran Klukas*  
*Christopher Klukas*  
*Writing*  

- Mr. Bennet: He is a rather amiable man who likes to give half answers to his wife and some of his daughters to see what they will do. He is a loving father to his two oldest though and towards the end of the book begins to reign in his youngest from her wild ways. He is happy to sit in his study and read all day.  

- Mrs. Bennet: She is a very silly woman who has a tendency toward drama and constantly complains about her “nerves”. She encourages her two youngest daughters in their wild ways and has a tendency to always respond to the situations she is in with the wrong response. She is generally happy to visit others in her neighborhood and gossip.  

- Mr. Bingley: He is a reserved man who doesn’t socialize very well with people he doesn’t know. He can be rather blunt in his manner and actions, but on the whole means well. He expresses his love to Elizabeth very strongly and continues to love her deeply at the end of the book.  

- Mr. Darcy: A pretty flat character who is nice and marries Jane. He is often swayed in opinion by Mr. Bingley.  

- Elizabeth: She is a headstrong young woman with strong opinions; she despises Mr. Bingley at first, but then over the course of the book grows to love him. She helps balance Jane's good opinion of everyone, with her more critical view of others. She is an attentive sister and wants the best for her family.  

- Mr. Collins: A rather flat character; he is very polite and constantly flatters everyone he meets, leading those with more sense in the book to dislike him. He marries Caroline but doesn’t seem to particularly have great affection for her but rather considers it a duty. He also yields very easily to Lady Catherine de Bur.  

- Caroline: She is a bit of a flat character and is good friends with Elizabeth; she is very practical and marries Mr. Collins as he has a stable income and future.  

- Mr. Wickam: He is the son of Mr. Bingley Senior’s estate manager and grew up with Mr. Bingley. He squandered the money left for him and has been traveling around, racking up debts and then skipping town before finally joining the Militia. He convinces Lydia to come with him to London, and then refuses to marry her unless he is paid to do so. Furthermore, he is a wonderful social engineer and can very easily manipulate others.  

- Lydia: A very flat character who only likes balls, parties, and fancy clothes. She is constantly running after Militia members when at home and after going away with the wife of a colonel on vacation she runs away with Wickham, causing her family much grief. She returns without a care in the world and is very self-centered.  

- Kitty: She is Lydia’s older sister but follows everything her young sister does, giving her a wild reputation like her sister. When Lydia is removed from them, her manners mild significantly, and she becomes more well-behaved.
