> Animal Farm, oh Animal Farm  
> How you have fallen  
> Striven for success but robed in mud  
> Thy glory days have gone  
> What used to be the paradise of animals everywhere  
> Has become the fane of Napoleon the crier  
> It started with thy milk and apples  
> And devolved to whip and waddle  
> Thy commandments which so inspired  
> Have become an epitome of muck and mire  
> Snowball the valiant pig has become the Trotsky of the wood  
> The very thing you once despised  `
> Has become your master
